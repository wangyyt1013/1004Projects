## Programming Project 3 
### Due October 15, 11:59PM
---------------------------------

Do the following

**Problem 1 (30 points)**
Programming Project P6.6 in *Big Java*. 

I have provided templates for the following files:

* `Nim.java`: This is the test class. *Do not modify it*.
* `Game.java`: This class should be completed by you.
* `Computer.java`: This class should be completed by you.
* `Human.java`: This class should be completed by you.

**Problem 2 (30 points)**
Programming Project P8.6 in *Big Java*. 

This time I have provided a single template only, `ZipTest.java`. Your code *must* work with the ZipTest class I have provided.
 
**What to hand in:**  
In addition to the source files for your programs include a single text file named readMe.txt with an explanation of what you did for each programming problem. That is, write in plain English, instructions for using your software, explanations for how and why you chose to design your code the way you did. The readMe.txt file is also an opportunity for you to get partial credit when certain requirements of the assignment are not met.  Add the readMe.txt file to the project's root directory on codio along with all of the .java files.

### Submitting your assignment
Please develop your programs on Codio but submit all of your work on Canvas. You must export source code from codio, then together with your readMe.txt compress them into a single zip file, and submit it on Canvas. The compressed file you submit should be called [your UNI]_pp3.zip so for example my submission would be called ac1076_pp3.zip     
    


### A word about Grading: 
Each programming question on assignment will be graded as follows:

* 30% if it compiles  
* 30% if it runs properly (expected output for given input, etc.)  
* 20% for style (formatting of code, variable names, comments, etc. Use the style guide posted on Coursworks!)  
* 20% for design (efficiency, class  organization, method length, etc...)  

Please make sure your programs at least compile before you submit them! There will be no partial credit for a program that "almost" compiles.
