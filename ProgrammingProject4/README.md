### PROGRAMMING (60 points)

**Video Poker:**  Do PROGRAMMING PROJECT  Project P7.9 in the 6th Edition of Big Java 
 
You must follow the instructions below to receive credit for this assignment. 
 
Instead of your player betting a single token each time, allow the player to bet between 1-5 tokens. If a player bets *n* tokens they win *n* times as much as indicated in the textbook prompt.  

Your program must use the included templates. These templates are for the classes: Card, Deck, Game, Player, and a test class, TestPoker. You will need to fill-in the existing methods and may want to add more methods and/or instance variables to any or all of these classes except for the test class TestPoker. TestPoker must remain exactly as it is here. 

This project requires you to have two versions of your game each constructed using a different version of the Game constructor. One will require an explicit parameter that you will get as a command-line argument, this is to help you (and us) test your code. That is, it will allow the user to specify the hand that the player gets which will help in testing if your game correctly identifies the various hands. Carefully read the comments in the template files to help you understand how this will work.
 
We will discuss design decisions and more for this project in lecture, so be sure to come to class!
 
Good luck!


**What to hand in**:

Templates for the five source files are located in the Assignment 4 workspace on Codio. In addition to the source files  include a text file named readMe.txt with an explanation of how your program works. That is, write in plain English, instructions for using your software, explanations for how and why you chose to design your code the way you did. The readMe.txt file is also an opportunity for you to get partial credit when certain requirements of the assignment are not met. 

### Submitting your work:

Please sumbit the source code and the `readMe.txt` on Canvas. You must export them from codio, compress them into a single zip file, and submit them on Canvas. The compressed file you submit should be called [your UNI]_pp4.zip so for example my submission would be called ac1076_pp4.zip


### A word about Grading: 
This assignment is worth 60 points. we will use the following guideline for awarding points:

* 30% if it compiles  
* 30% if it runs properly (expected output for given input, etc.)  
* 20% for style (formatting of code, variable names, comments, etc. Use the style guide posted on Coursworks!)  
* 20% for design (efficiency, short methods, etc.)  

Please make sure your program at least compiles before you submit it! There will be no partial credit for a program that "almost" compiles.
